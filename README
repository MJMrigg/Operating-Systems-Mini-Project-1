The Operating Systems Mini Project 1 is a project created by the students of Florida Polytechnic University for the COP-4610 Section 3 Operating Systems Concepts course taught by Dr. Luis Jaimes. The aim of the project is to use xv6 to accomplish three goals:

A.) Create a file that prints system call that returns the number of times the function getpid() has been called. 
B.) Create a file that prints the number of system calls the operating system has called.
C.) Create a file that prints the number of successful system calls.

Running the Project:
To run the project, it is assume that you have Ubuntu downloaded on your computer. If you do not, see the installing_instructions file.
1.) Move the project to a directory that is easily accessible and not behind permissions.
2.) Start Ubuntu from the command prompt and type the "cd .." command. This will take you to the root of the Ubuntu system. 
3.) From the root, navigate to mnt/path_to_your_xv6_directory.
4.) Once you have arrived at your directory, run the command "make qemu-nox". This will compile and run xv6.
5.) From there, you can run commands in your xv6 environment. See the users/makefile.mk for list of valid commands.
6.) To exit xv6, quickly press ctrl+a, release, and press x on your keyboard.

Commands Associated with each Goal:
A - getpid, PartA
B - PartB
C - PartC

Note: This project was developed in a Windows 11 environment. Results on other operating systems may vary.
