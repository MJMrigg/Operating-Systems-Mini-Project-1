sudo apt update
sudo apt-get build-essentials or sudo apt install build-essential

Then isntall qemu

sudo apt -get install qemu or sudo apt install qemu

Run qemu by running the following instruction

if you get an error like "user/sh.c:58:1: error: infinite recursion detected [-Werror=infinite-recursion]", open Makefile and comment out the line
